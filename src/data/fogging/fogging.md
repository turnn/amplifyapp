# Fogging System
Fogging systems are widely used in high-care food production to enable CIP sanitisation. When a client which had such a system installed had to relocate factory, I was consulted regarding relocation of the system.

Although the original system was effective in the original location, the new production area was double the size of the original production floor, necessitating the redesign of the system.

The original design used 10 individual SS302 self-siphoning nozzles, which necessitated 10 sanitiser bottles being located throughout the facility. This system was prone to nozzle failure, and required bottles to be refilled frequently.

The new design used roof-mounted 360 degree chemical-compatible polypropylene nozzle assemblies fed via a ground-located pressure pot.

The use of the polypropylene nozzle assemblies reduced the project cost by 50%, as well as reducing system complexity and reoccuring labour costs, whilst increasing reliability and extensibility.
